Unfortunately, the cabal file does not work due to 'Butterfy effect' problems
http://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/the-butterfly-effect-in-cabal/

To start the web application, install all required libraries, solve conflicts, 
and then run:

> ghci -i./src ./src/Main.hs

After ghci starts successfully, call `main' to start the web server.

Then, access the web application at http://localhost:8000/
To log in as S (superuser), the database contains the following account:
Username: 'admin', Password: 'admin' (without the quotes).

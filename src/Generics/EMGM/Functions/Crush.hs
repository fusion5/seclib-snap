-- Summary: Generic functions that crush a container into an iteration over
-- its elements.
--
-- Crush is a datatype-generic operation on container types. It is a
-- generalization of folds, but it is not a catamorphism. To understand how
-- crush works, one can think of it as generating a list of all elements and
-- mapping an accumulating function over each one. With this image in mind, it
-- is evident that (unlike a catamorphism) very little information can be
-- determined about the structure of the container.
--
-- The EMGM implementation of 'crush' can not inherently know the associativity
-- of the binary operator. Consequently, associativity is left as an argument,
-- but there are variants specific to left- and right-associativity for
-- convenience.
--
-- Many standard Haskell datatypes (e.g. @[]@, @Data.Tree@) are designed such
-- that a constructor with more than one argument (i.e. a product structurally
-- represented by @(:*:)@) has the element on the left and any recursive points
-- towards the right. Due to this, the right-associative functions would
-- typically produce the expected values. See examples in the comments for
-- 'flattenr' and 'firstr'.
